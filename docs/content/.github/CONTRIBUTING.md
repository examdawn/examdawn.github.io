# Contribution Guidelines

### Rules
We are fairly lax with rules in order to build a community quickly but here are some non negotiable things:
- Do not plagiarize content from websites, books, or other sources. 
- List sources, if used, at the bottom
- If AI was involved, mention so in the Pull Request(and to what extent).
    - This will not hurt your chance at getting the content merged, since it mainly depends on quality. 

### Commit Format:
Commit Title:
- Format: `Course: Subject(short): 1-line Explanation of the change`
- eg. `BCA: DBMS: Question 29 from Unit 1`

Commit Description: 
- Optional
- General Explanation
- eg. `Solved Question 29 from Unit 1 about Attributes`

### Next Step
After you are done and you push the change to your fork, send a Pull Request to this repository.
