On Oct 15th, 2024, 42 Students and 2 lecturers from Gopalan College of Commerce(BCA) visited the 
Hindustan Aeronautics Limited(HAL) Museum to learn about the history of planes and a very high level overview of how they work. The objective of the trip was to observe the rich history of planes and the engineering behind them. 

Although the 2nd trip of the day to Vishveshwarya Industrial Technological Museum was cancelled because of the rain and delays and many students fell sick the following days due to rain, it was a fun journey which enabled us to learn about something new.
