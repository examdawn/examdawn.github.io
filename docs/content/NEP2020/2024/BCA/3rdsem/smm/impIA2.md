    - However, the main difference is that the two accounts must mutually follow each other
- Tags encourage engagements
    - The @ symbol on Twitter goes a long way. 
    - It’s the key to sending other users a notification that almost guarantees your tweet, or the tweet you wanted the @ recipient to see, gets viewed. 
    - Also, it’s easy attribution for a quote or an article you share on the platform.
- Posting multiple times per day is expected, not annoying
    - Twitter is the only social network where marketers are recommended to post up to 15 times per day. 
- Your profile will drive traffic to your site
    - Social media profiles are the new homepage
