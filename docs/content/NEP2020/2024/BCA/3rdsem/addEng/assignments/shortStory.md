## Story (Chapter 1/10):

<!-- Exposition -->
Clang! The sword shattered into pieces as Rian, known as the strongest adventurer in the continent, fell to his knees, facing a monstrous foe. The odds of victory were zero; even his teammates lay defeated at the enemy's feet. And as the monstrous foe was about to give his final blow to Rian, as he swung his sword *Ping!* The sound of Heavenly sword echoed the battle field creating Awe and fear which gripped the hearts of all the soldiers who heard it up close. 

Leading the war was a mystical swordsman with the power of overturning a whole continent in a single snap. He was the only hope, the beacon of light to all the people of the planet. But lets take about this in the upcoming future... Let's come back to the past, where there lived a young swordsman named Eren living in a serene village of crustlewood far from the royal capital city Stantom, training in his garden under the unmerciful sun unaware of the fate that awaited him. Eren was born in a commoner family of adventures, lost his parents at a very tender age due to the monster stampede that occurred at the outskirts of village that wiped 10% population from the kingdom. As usual, He wake early in the morning to hunt food and grab herbs; Hunting beasts and gathering herbs came as naturally to him. He earn living by selling the meat and skin of what he hunts, along with herbs that he obtain from the nearby forest, As he wandered through the village with the purpose of selling his goods, he notices that the villagers whisper to themselves, but he couldn't care less - he was focused on making his living and taking care of his sister

<!-- Rising Action -->

Eren was no fool, he knew the other villagers were actively taking advantage of him - skimming him for prices and sending him for silly fetch quests and such but he had to hunt for the sake of his ill sister. He met with the local librarian who was taking care of them both and the local bard at the tavern who was the librarian's brother, Aether. Lumine, the librarian, asked them to venture out into the wilderness to hunt a few boars for money so he could buy some medicine for his sister. He readily agreed since they were the only ones who readily accepted Eren and Tina and therefore deeply trusted them.

<!-- Tina = sis
Lumine = librarian
Aether = bard
-->
He got up the next morning and went to the wilderness close to the dungeon, a bit beyond the regular place and saw some powerful looking shadows. Nobody knew what these shadows were but they attacked humans when they felt threatened and kept running towards people so they were generally regarded as dangerous. He wondered, "What are shadows doing so close to the city?"

He slaughtered them, thinking they were just monsters out to cause harm and thanks to some curiousity, carried on into the dungeon despite having everything he needed. <!--I'm straight up copying nier replicant fr-->

<!-- Climax-->
He saw a pair of powerful shadows puppeting machines guarding something that looked like a book. He was told of an ancient, all knowing talking Grimoire which was instrumental in winning an ancient war. But he thought that was just a bit of folklore... upto now since he had seen it with his own eyes.


The twin shadows were a perfect pair, they'd defend each other perfectly and attack to ensure that they would always be better than their opponents.

<!-- Transition to falling action -->
He fought a long and arduous battle but when on the verge of losing, the grimoire reached out to him and granted him access to its magic abilities and ranged attacks. Using this, he targets one of them, knocks it down temporarily with his ranged attacks and targets its weakness to incapacitate it. Then he went for the puppet's sister and defeated it using his superior swordsmanship.


<!-- Conclusion -->
On heading back, Lumine was extremely upset at Eren for venturing too deep and getting to his home covered in cuts and bruises. For some reason, Lumine acted suspicious when she saw the talking Grimoire, almost as if she knew him... "Just thinking about it gives me a bad feeling". But he couldn't bring himself to suspect her... She had taken care of him for years

 He gave the medicine to Tina with the money he got from and read her a book to put her to sleep.




## Story (Chapter 2/10)

<!--Summary transitioning to Exposition--> 
He left the village knowing that Lumine and Aether would take care of his sister and went to Royal Acadamy of Sword and Magic, a prestigious institution known for training the finest warriors and mages to learn the art of the Sword; Eren had heard rumors that the acadamy gave Nobles special privileges... As commoners like him would have to face a dificult battle to gain enrollment. 

Upon entering the acadamies examination ground, he couldn't believe what his eyes - The academy treated both nobles and commoners as equals, with the only difference being that the nobles were allowed to bring a maid or a butler to assist them. 

He made his way to the line for the examination, and as he approached the office, he was welcomed by a piercing gaze from a woman, who despite her appearance, looked gentle. Lexie was Lumine's childhood friend and was responsible for the day to day management of the royal academy



"Hi, Welcome! Eren... let's see", said Lexie as she sorted through her cabinet, "Ah! Here is your file. It says here that you are bringing a pet?"

<!--"Liber Umbrarum" - the dark book-->
Liber "Umbra" Umbrarum: "Umbra is not a pet! If anything, this young'in is my little familiar

"What even are you? I've never seen a talking book before", asked Lexie, clearly amused.

Umbra: "Umbra is Umbra! An Ancient Grimoire with infinite wisdom! and the power to command shadows I was a war strategist back in... huh... I... can't remember"

"Anyways, Eren... Are you applying for the exam this time again? You almost passed the lst time", asked Lexia.,"I saw you fight in the mock entrance battle test and I feel like you already have what it takes to graduate. I'll get the processing done for you"

Eren nodded and headed to the tavern. Aether, who was also a regular drunkard, talked to the manager at the city's local tavern and got accomodation for Eren there. 

<!-- Trans. to rising action-->
The next day, he rushed to the exam stadium and prepared his weapon. We couldn't bring his trusty Mythril Sword he found in the previous dungeon(this was done to discourage Nobles from gaming the exams using bought enchanted armour and accessories)

<!-- Umbra = female because I'm trying to distance from replicant-->
But he did register Umbra as his pet, much to her dissatisfaction - but this meant he could wield its ranged magic attacks 

<!-- Rising Action-->
He was matched up against a few people whom he easily defeated and climbed the leaderboards - making the lost, jealous students suspect his sword abilities. They felt he was cheating with that. Whispers circulated about a newcomer rising through the rank in a single week, and the students, who all assumed the newcomer had used connections to win against others, directly challenged him, believing he was cheating. The partiality of student who challenged him was his senior believing that he had weak sword abilities and no knowledge of any sword art. However they were all defeated in a single swing, shattering their pride in an instant. While some acknowledged his strength, others envied it and decided to seek revenge later <!-- but was unsucessful. | Lil Bro was Unsuccessful :sob: :sob: --> 

As he was strolling through the academy, he saw a single student. She looked troubled, but as he got closer to the student, it was clear that it was her first day at the academy and did not know the direction to the lecture room for <!--rizzcraft--> the first class of the day, Magic Literacy. 

<!-- TODO: interaction. I dont want to make the mc a loner-->
<!-- The heroine should be untidy in the first meeting as she was running late. Cool, works for me btw he forgets to ask her name in the first meeting. Keep this, gr8 idea-->

This was supposed to be a simple introduction to magic with the ability to do basic magic, cast simple day to day useful spells, perform advanced computations and how to get started on reading complex magic textbooks. For some reason, Eren had no aptitude for magic and the most basic spells failed him - he could never get them right and his day-to-day proficiency was on par with a normal infant. XX on the other hand, was surprisingly good at it, despite not looking the part since children who have practiced magic from an early age are usually extremely well dressed.

Then, they practice some sword craft, attended a lecture on Applied Magic, and went home.
